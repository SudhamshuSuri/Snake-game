# Snake-game
Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first project in python that I am confident on sharing. This is the classic snake game recreated in Python using Turtle Graphics.
This project was made uding Object Oriented Prognaming that I learnt from a course on Udemy.
I am still learning Python and am fascinated by what more projects I can build.
This is my first game in Python.
Enjoy!
